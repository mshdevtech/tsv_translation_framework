"""
Script to sync Lua files from _upstream/en to translation folder.
Only replaces existing files, reports deleted ones.

This script is designed for syncing translated Lua scripts with original ones from MK1212AD mod
that can be updated from time to time. It performs a safe sync by only replacing files
that already exist in the translation folder, preventing accidental overwrites.

USAGE EXAMPLES:
    # Basic usage - run from project root
    python scripts/sync_lua_files.py
    
    # Run from scripts directory
    cd scripts
    python sync_lua_files.py
    
    # Run with verbose output (if you want to see all skipped files)
    python scripts/sync_lua_files.py | tee sync_log.txt

WHAT IT DOES:
    1. Scans _upstream/en directory for all .lua files
    2. Scans translation directory for existing .lua files
    3. Copies upstream files to translation folder ONLY if they already exist there
    4. Reports files that were skipped (not in translation)
    5. Reports files that exist in translation but were deleted from upstream
    6. Provides a summary of all operations

SAFETY FEATURES:
    - Never creates new files in translation folder
    - Only overwrites existing files
    - Preserves file permissions and timestamps
    - Creates backup-friendly output for git diff review

AFTER RUNNING:
    - Review changes with: git diff
    - Check for any unexpected modifications
    - Commit changes if satisfied: git add . && git commit -m "Sync Lua files from upstream"
